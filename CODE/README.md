The main script is "HMM-CUSUM.py".
Its dependency is "CUSUM-supportlib.py".
The data is "clusters.csv", where the CUSUM algorithm is applied, and "angle.csv", where the CUSUM-like algorithm is applied.
The script "rearrange-clusters.py" is used on "clusters.csv" to remedy some of the short-commings of the clustering algorithm that was used to create the clusters.
